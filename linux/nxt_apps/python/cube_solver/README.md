# Python Rubik's Cube Solver

This Python application will use my NXT remote control library with its Python binding `nxt_remote_py` to control the

## HIGHLY_WORK_IN_PROGRESS

### Notes

Pup Python module into the `PYTHONPATH`:

````
export PYTHONPATH=~/Develop/rpi-nxt2/build/linux_debug/linux/nxt_remote
````
